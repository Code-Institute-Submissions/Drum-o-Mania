### Testing

- I have tested that this website is responsive, looks good and works as intended on the different standard screen sizes, using the devtools device toolbar in Google Chrome.

- I have tested that this website works in different browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox.

- I have confirmed that the audio/video controls are fully functional.

- I have confirmed that the navigation bar is fully functional. Hovering over the link changes the color, staying on a specific page activates an underline of that link, and the links direct you to the correct page. 

- I have confirmed that the form works, the email field will only accept text in email format and the submit button works.
